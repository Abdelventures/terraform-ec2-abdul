1. EGRC Data Classification Update
	•	Current classification: Data Class 2 (Internal)
	•	New classification: Data Class 4 (Private)
	•	Justification: Contains access control lists that reveal who has access to what, making it sensitive.
	•	Potential security risk: Could be targeted by adversaries to exploit privileged access.
	•	Impact: No major changes needed for the project itself, but security posture will be improved.
	•	Update expected by EOD.

2. Security & Compliance Standards (From Data Classification & Handling Standard)
	•	Electronic Storage:
	•	Encryption at rest required for Data Class 4.
	•	SQL Server 2019 already inherits AES-256 encryption → No changes needed.
	•	Electronic Transport:
	•	All transmissions must be encrypted.
	•	SFTP (TLS-encrypted) will be used for secure data transfers.
	•	PGP encryption for additional security is optional but recommended.
	•	Physical Storage & Transport:
	•	Data must be securely stored (e.g., locked cabinets).
	•	If physically transported, approved couriers must be used.
	•	Disposal & Media Handling:
	•	Secure Shred-it bins required for disposal.
	•	No write access permitted to portable media.

3. File Transmission & Storage Considerations
	•	Source-side (LS1) file generation is already set up.
	•	Focus is on how the target location receives & processes files.
	•	Transmission Methods Considered:
	1.	SFTP Gateway (Preferred option)
	•	No installation required.
	•	Uses existing secure FTP processes.
	2.	SMB Shared Drive (Needs confirmation)
	•	Requires checking with storage/data protection team.
	3.	Agent-Based Transfer (Ruled out)
	•	Not an option due to installation constraints.
	•	SSIS will be used for file loading into the target database.
	•	Transmission team will handle movement to the correct target location.

4. Resiliency & Tiering Considerations
	•	Recovery Point Objective (RPO) & availability requirements will influence the final implementation.
	•	System team will adjust based on the provided requirements.

Next Steps:
	•	Update EGRC Data Classification to Class 4 (Target: EOD).
	•	Meet with Transmission Team later today to finalize file movement specifics.
	•	Confirm feasibility of SMB shared drive with storage/data protection team.
	•	Schedule Stakeholder Review (Target: Next week).
	•	Ensure target file handling process mirrors the source setup (SSIS placement & loading).
	•	Monitor evolving Zero Trust security updates for future enhancements.

⸻

Final Notes:
	•	Encryption at rest is already in place (AES-256 for SQL Server).
	•	All transmissions will be encrypted (SFTP/TLS).
	•	No mounting of file shares on database servers (per policy).
	•	Data handling requirements align with the company’s security standards.
