It sounds like the plan is shifting a bit, with the immediate focus on finalizing the current production deployment while preparing for the transition to the new app code. Here are the key takeaways from this discussion:
	1.	Prod Deployment Status:
	•	The application is deployed in Prod and is currently being tested.
	•	The load balancer setup is pending.
	•	DR setup needs to be reviewed.
	•	Once validated, the app team will take ownership.
	2.	Next Steps for the New App Code:
	•	A new app code has been created, but various dependencies need to be requested, including:
	•	Veracode and SonarQube projects
	•	Artifact repositories
	•	AD groups
	•	Pipeline setup
	•	Deployment will start in Dev first, then progress to Cert and Prod.
	•	Security and architecture reviews are pending and must be completed.
	3.	Cert Environment Issues:
	•	Backend memory issues need to be resolved.
	•	Some challenges with Azure cert and prod environments are being investigated.
	4.	Tracking and Coordination:
	•	Once the app team provides detailed requirements, work items will be created.
	•	Efforts for switching to the new app code will be estimated and planned accordingly.
	•	Satish has handed off the completed Prod setup to the app team.

Immediate Actions:
	•	Cert Backend Fixes: Investigate and resolve memory issues.
	•	Load Balancer Setup: Confirm and complete for prod.
	•	New App Code Prep: Gather and request necessary components.
	•	Security & Architecture Reviews: Initiate formal reviews.
	•	Tracking Work Items: Create stories for completed prod work.

Would you like me to summarize this for the team in a more structured format, like a document or meeting notes?
