It sounds like a productive discussion covering database architecture, data migration, and responsibilities for setup. A few key takeaways:
	1.	Database Architecture
	•	The Workday-related database in Colo is separate from the main Workday database in LS1, but data will be transferred using SSIS packages.
	•	The System Access Tracker and Workday app database will reside on the same database server but remain separate databases.
	•	There is no need for an active-active database setup, and DC-16 is currently considered the primary, with DC-21 as DR.
	•	Disaster recovery includes three locations, including CS3 as a secondary DR option.
	2.	Database & Server Setup Responsibility
	•	The application team is expected to set up the databases, but guidance and request assistance from the database engineering team will be needed.
	•	There’s an effort to centralize documentation on database processes for better visibility and support.
	•	Stacy’s team is involved in setting up the servers and managing the database migration from legacy to Colo.
	3.	Next Steps
	•	Finalization and approval of the architecture by network and internal teams.
	•	Once approved, a detailed design review will be shared to ensure alignment before implementation.
	•	Requests for database setup and migration will be coordinated with the database team.
