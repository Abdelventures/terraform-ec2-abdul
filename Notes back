1. Resource Provider and Feature Availability
Reasoning
Azure’s Data Protection service may require certain resource providers or preview features to be enabled on your subscription, especially for PostgreSQL Flexible Server backups.
If the Microsoft.DataProtection provider is not registered (or fully registered), calls to create a backup instance can fail with unexpected HTTP status codes.
Solution
Check Resource Provider Registration
bash
Copy
Edit
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.DataProtection --query "registrationState"
If the registration state is not Registered, run:
bash
Copy
Edit
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DataProtection
Check for Preview Features
Certain backup capabilities for PostgreSQL Flexible Server might still be in preview for your region.
Consult Azure documentation or contact Microsoft Support to confirm if a public preview or private preview needs enabling in your subscription.
2. Backup Policy or Backup Vault Misconfiguration
Reasoning
An HTTP 406 can occur if the Backup Policy or Backup Vault is not correctly set up for PostgreSQL workload protection.
If the vault is configured for some other workload types (e.g., Azure VMs only) and not Azure Database for PostgreSQL, the request might be rejected.
Solution
Validate Backup Vault Settings
Ensure the vault is in the same region (or a region that supports cross-region backups for PostgreSQL) as the PostgreSQL Flexible Server.
Check the vault’s type supports Azure Database (PostgreSQL) backups.
Check/Update the Backup Policy
Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
az backup policy list \
  --vault-name "m-ARK-7buv-AmlRisk-01" \
  --resource-group "m-ARK-7rsg-AmlRiskAssessment-01"
Confirm at least one policy is designed for AzureWorkload and PostgreSQL.
If missing, create a new policy (or edit the existing one) specifically for PostgreSQL Flexible Server.
3. Incorrect Terraform Resource Configuration
Reasoning
The Terraform resource azurerm_data_protection_backup_instance_postgresql_flexible_server is relatively new. If you’re using an older version of the AzureRM provider, it might not handle this resource correctly.
A mismatch between source_resource_id (the PostgreSQL Flexible Server ID) and the vault region/policy can result in a 406 response because the resource is “not acceptable” under the currently registered protection configuration.
Solution
Upgrade the AzureRM Provider
In your providers.tf (or wherever you specify the provider version), ensure you’re on a recent version:
hcl
Copy
Edit
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 3.50"  # or newer
    }
  }
}
Run terraform init -upgrade to update the provider.
Double-Check Resource IDs
Ensure source_resource_id is the full resource ID of the PostgreSQL Flexible Server, typically:
bash
Copy
Edit
/subscriptions/<SUB_ID>/resourceGroups/<RG_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers/<SERVER_NAME>
Validate Region Consistency
Confirm the resource group, vault, and the server’s location align (or that cross-region backup is supported, if needed).
4. Networking Constraints & Private Endpoints
Reasoning
If the PostgreSQL Flexible Server is configured with private endpoints (private access only) and no public endpoints, the Azure Data Protection service might be blocked or may not have the correct access path. This can lead to ambiguous errors (sometimes 406 or 400) if the service cannot validate or connect to the database resource.
Solution
Check Networking Mode
Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
az postgres flexible-server show \
  --name "m-ARK-7bui-AmlRisk-01" \
  --resource-group "m-ARK-7rsg-AmlRiskAssessment-01" \
  --query "network.publicNetworkAccess"
If Disabled, confirm that you have set up a private link or service endpoint that Azure Backup can use.
Add Required Firewall or VNet Rules
If you must keep the server private, ensure the Azure Backup service’s IP ranges or service tags are allowed.
Refer to Microsoft documentation for enabling private endpoints for backup.
5. Subscription & RBAC Permissions
Reasoning
The service principal (SP) that Terraform uses or the Backup Vault’s managed identity needs sufficient RBAC permissions to create and manage backups for a resource.
If the correct role (e.g., Backup Contributor) is missing, Azure might respond with an error code that does not always accurately reflect a permission issue.
Solution
Check Role Assignments
bash
Copy
Edit
az role assignment list \
  --scope "/subscriptions/6ea7362b-c0d4-4887-90f9-5a4d1c6fd9e9/resourceGroups/m-ARK-7rsg-AmlRiskAssessment-01/providers/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers/m-ARK-7bui-AmlRisk-01" \
  --query "[].{roleDefinitionName:roleDefinitionName,principalName:principalName}"
Look for the principal used by Terraform or the vault’s managed identity.
Assign or Update Roles
If missing, assign Backup Contributor or an equivalent custom role that grants the necessary permissions:
bash
Copy
Edit
az role assignment create \
  --role "Backup Contributor" \
  --assignee <ServicePrincipal_or_ManagedIdentity_ID> \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<SUB_ID>/resourceGroups/<RG_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers/<SERVER_NAME>"
6. Potential Version or Feature Limitations of PostgreSQL Server
Reasoning
Azure backups for PostgreSQL Flexible Server may require specific versions of PostgreSQL (e.g., 11 and above, or 13+ in certain scenarios).
If your server is on a version not supported by the backup extension, the request can fail.
Solution
Check PostgreSQL Version
bash
Copy
Edit
az postgres flexible-server show --name <SERVER_NAME> --resource-group <RG_NAME> --query "version"
Upgrade if Needed
If your version is below the supported threshold, consider upgrading to a supported version.
7. Use Detailed Debug Logs & Azure Activity Logs
Reasoning
When the Azure REST API responds with 406 and no body, it can be difficult to see exactly where the mismatch occurs. Terraform logs combined with Azure Activity Logs can sometimes fill in the missing context.
Solution
Terraform Debug Mode
bash
Copy
Edit
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
terraform apply
Inspect logs in your console for any additional clues.
Azure Activity Logs in Azure Portal
Navigate to Monitor → Activity Log → Filter by Resource Group and time range.
Look for any Microsoft.DataProtection or Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL error events.
Sometimes the “Extended JSON” fields in the Activity Log provide a more descriptive error message.
Summary of Advanced Steps
Register and check the Microsoft.DataProtection resource provider and any preview features required.
Ensure the Backup Vault and Backup Policy both support PostgreSQL workload protection.
Upgrade the AzureRM Terraform provider version to include the latest features and bug fixes.
Verify correct resource IDs, consistent location/region settings, and cross-region support (if applicable).
Review networking: If using private endpoints, ensure Azure Backup can connect.
Assign the correct RBAC roles (Backup Contributor) to the service principal or managed identity.
Check the PostgreSQL version for flexible server to ensure it’s supported for Data Protection backups.
Use detailed logs (Terraform debug logs and Azure Activity Logs) to uncover extra error details that are not shown in the 406 response.
By systematically checking each of these points, you can resolve the root cause of the 406 Not Acceptable error and successfully create a backup instance for your PostgreSQL Flexible Server using Azure Data Protection.
