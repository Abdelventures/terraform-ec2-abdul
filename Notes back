Treasury Center Migration to Strivacity Plan - Proposed
Introduction and Background

M&T Bank has decided to adopt a common and centralized authentication model with the goals to improve the overall capabilities (features), scalability, flexibility, and to reduce the cost of maintaining multiple software licenses. The bank has selected Strivacity as the platform that all customer facing applications will use for authentication. 

As migration from the existing platform is required it is import to carefully plan the migration. This plan outlines a two-phased approach to migrate the authentication system from SiteMinder to Strivacity.

The migration prioritizes taking a low-risk approach for a company-based rollout with a token translation layer (e.g. APIM) for session synchronization.

The plan also includes a comprehensive rollback strategy to minimize downtime and ensure business continuity should any problems arise.

Project Scope and Objectives

Migrate the authentication system from SiteMinder to Strivacity.

Maintain Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality for various applications (SiteMinder apps, PingFederate apps, Direct Connect apps like QuickBooks).

Minimize disruption to user experience and prioritize security throughout the process.

Data Migration Strategy

User identity and credential information ( usernames, hashed passwords) will be migrated from Oracle LDAP to Strivacity at the onset of this project in the current Oracle LDAP hashed format.  The current Oracle LDAP SSH secure one-way, strong hashing algorithm will be used to protect password confidentiality during migration. The hashed passwords will be converted to the ARGON2 hashing algorithm as users login in for the first time through Strivacity to maintain consistency across all identities stored in Strivacity.

Identify additional user attributes required by applications that are not currently stored in Oracle LDAP will be identified and collected through a user self-service portal or other designated method. This is possible due to Strivacity’s flexible data model.

Current State Analysis

Existing authentication system: SiteMinder & Oracle ODSEE LDAP

Supported functionalities:

Login, Password reset,  

MFA (RSA tokens  PING ID or Activ Identity tokens),

SSO for various applications (SiteMinder apps, PingFederate apps, Direct Connect apps like QuickBooks)

Currently, Password reset and MFA with tokens is not done through SiteMinder but will be consolidated into Strivacity as the target state.

Migration Strategy and Approach

Phased rollout with a focus on migrating entire companies at once to minimize disruption.

Phase 1: Migrate core login functionalities to Strivacity while maintaining SSO via a token translation layer for SiteMinder apps.

Phase 2: Migrate SSO functionalities for different application types:

Sub-phase 2A: Migrate SiteMinder apps by leveraging the token translation layer.

Sub-phase 2B: Migrate PingFederate apps through direct SAML integration with Strivacity.

Sub-phase 2C: Update configurations for directly connected apps (QuickBooks, NetSuite).

→ QUESTION: Is there something you can say that’s a little more specific about what’s entailed with the “configuration updates” referenced above?

Project Timeline and Resources

The product teams will need to define timelines for each phase (Phase 1 and Phase 2 with sub-phases).

Allocate resources for development, testing, migration execution, and rollback procedures.

Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Any change will usually inherently come with a certain level of risks, regardless of the system that we migrate to there will be risks involved.  The most pragmatic approach is to identify the potential risks and their mitigation strategies.

Potential risks:

Login functionality issues on Strivacity

Security vulnerabilities in Strivacity or the token translation layer

SSO functionality issues during migration for different application types

Mitigation strategies:

Phased rollout with rollback plan

Security testing throughout the process

Close monitoring and performance checks after each migration step

Communication and Training Plan

Develop a communication plan to keep stakeholders and users informed about the migration process and potential downtime during rollbacks.

Consider user training for the new Strivacity login process and any required self-service actions for additional user attributes.

Engage with The Change Management team. As they will also have to train the support staff on how to service customers through this platform.  Moving to a platform like Strivacity will enable M&T to deliver a consistent enterprise wide customer support experience due to the platform consistency gained by adopting Strivacity and the only actual change is the workflow differences between things like passcodes vs pins.

Testing and Validation

Conduct thorough testing of the Strivacity login functionalities and the token translation layer during Phase 1.

Test the migration process for each application type (SiteMinder apps, PingFederate apps, Direct Connect apps) in a test environment before real-world migration.

Include rollback testing to ensure the procedures are well-defined and practiced.

Post-Migration Support

Deployment teams to provide ongoing support to address any issues that may arise after the migration.

Monitor the performance of the new authentication system and make adjustments as needed.

Breakdown of the Token Translation Process:

The token translation service acts as a critical intermediary during the migration, enabling a smooth transition from SiteMinder to Strivacity for user authentication while maintaining SSO functionality for SiteMinder apps.

User Login through SiteMinder (Step 1 from diagram above):

A user attempts to access a web application protected by SiteMinder.

The user enters their credentials on the SiteMinder login page.

SiteMinder performs user authentication against Oracle LDAP. This may  involves checking passwords against the hashed password in Oracle LDAP using LDAP protocol

SiteMinder Authentication (Step 2 from diagram above):

Upon successful authentication, SiteMinder validates the user's access rights using existing processes (whatever is used today).

If access is granted, SiteMinder generates a temporary token containing user information and access permissions specific to the application. SiteMinder generates an encrypted SMSESSION cookie.

Token Translation by the Layer (Steps 3 - 6 from diagram above):

The SiteMinder token is sent to the token translation layer.

The translation layer intercepts the token and performs the following actions:

Decodes the SiteMinder token: It extracts relevant user information and access control data from the token's payload.

Maps user information: It may need to map user attributes from SiteMinder's format to a format compatible with Strivacity.

Creates a Strivacity token: It generates a new token in a format that Strivacity understands. This token may contain translated user information and access claims.

(Optional) Security Enhancements: The translation layer may implement additional security measures during translation, such as:

Encryption: Encrypting the translated token to protect sensitive user data while in transit.

Signing: Signing the translated token to ensure its integrity and prevent tampering.

Strivacity Authentication (using the translated token) (Steps 7-9 from diagram above):

The translated token is forwarded by the translation layer to Strivacity.

Strivacity receives the translated token and performs its own authentication process:

Validates the token format: It checks if the token structure and format are compatible with Strivacity's expectations.

Authenticates the user: It extracts user information from the translated token and validates it against its own internal user store or connected IdP.

Authorizes access: It verifies if the translated token grants the user access to the requested application based on the included access claims.

Single Sign-On (SSO) for SiteMinder Apps:

If authentication in Strivacity is successful, the user is granted access to the application without needing to re-enter their credentials.

This SSO functionality is achieved because the translated token contains the necessary information about the user and their access rights for the SiteMinder-protected application.

The user experience remains seamless, allowing them to access various applications previously secured by SiteMinder through a single login to Strivacity.

Benefits of Token Translation Layer:

Enables a smooth migration from SiteMinder to Strivacity by bridging the gap between their token formats.

Maintains SSO functionality for existing SiteMinder applications during the migration.

Provides flexibility by allowing for customization of the translation logic if needed.

Important Considerations:

The specific details of each step may vary depending on the chosen token translation solution (custom-built or pre-built) and the configuration of SiteMinder and Strivacity.

Security during the translation process is crucial. Encryption and signing of tokens can help protect sensitive user data.

Thorough testing of the token translation process is essential to ensure successful migration and continued functionality of SSO for SiteMinder applications.

Performance considerations - Adding any steps to an authentication process will introduce additional latency.  The goal is to keep this to a minimum, during migration, as to not impact user experience.

 

Technical Options for Token Translation Service:

The token translation service acts as a critical intermediary during the migration, enabling a smooth transition from SiteMinder to Strivacity for user authentication while maintaining SSO functionality for SiteMinder apps. Here are the technical options for implementing this service:

Utilize Existing Microsoft Azure API Management (APIM):

Consider using your existing Microsoft Azure API Management (APIM) deployment for the token translation service (APIM is currently being deployed at M&T).

APIM offers built-in capabilities for policy management and API transformation, which could potentially be leveraged to translate tokens.

Advantages:

Reduced development effort compared to building a custom translation layer from scratch.

Potential cost savings by leveraging an existing investment in APIM infrastructure.

Establishes an enterprise approach for these types of token translations which might arise within other business domains

 Disadvantages:

Requires a thorough assessment of APIM's token translation functionalities to ensure they meet your specific requirements (e.g., handling different token formats).

Additional configuration may be needed within APIM to handle specific token translation logic.

Develop a Custom Token Translation Layer:

This option involves building a custom software program specifically designed to translate tokens between SiteMinder and Strivacity.

 Advantages:

Provides complete control over the translation logic and functionalities.

Can be tailored to address specific requirements of your environment (e.g., handling non-standard token formats).

 Disadvantages:

Requires significant development effort and resource commitments which are in very short supply.

Demands ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure compatibility with future changes in SiteMinder or Strivacity APIs.

Security considerations need careful implementation to protect tokens during translation (e.g., strong encryption, access controls).

Leverage a Pre-built Token Translation Solution:

Explore existing software solutions designed for token translation between different identity providers. These solutions might offer pre-built connectors for SiteMinder and Strivacity, simplifying the integration process.

Advantages:

Faster implementation compared to custom development.

May require less technical expertise to set up and manage.

Some solutions offer ongoing support and updates from the vendor.

 Disadvantages:

May not offer the same level of customization as a custom solution.

Might have limitations in functionality depending on the chosen product (e.g., may not support specific token formats).

Licensing costs associated with the pre-built solution.

Extended time to market impacts due to TPRM and Cyber Approval processes involved if the new solution is not currently already used within the bank.

Choosing a Technical Option:

Consider a proof-of-concept evaluation for pre-built solutions to assess their suitability for your environment. This involves testing their ability to translate tokens between SiteMinder and Strivacity.

If a pre-built solution meets your requirements, it can be a faster and potentially more cost-effective approach compared to custom development.

Develop a custom token translation layer if specific needs for customization or control over the translation logic are crucial for your environment.

Performance impacts should be evaluated for each option 

Recommendation:

Evaluate the trade-offs between custom development, pre-built solutions, and utilizing existing APIM based on your technical expertise, budget, specific requirements for token translation logic, and existing infrastructure.

 

User Training and Communication

Partnering with Change Management is paramount to success

Project timeline and key milestones

Potential impact on user experience (e.g., temporary downtime during rollouts)

User training materials for the new Strivacity login process, including any required self-service actions for additional user attributes.

Communication channels for users to ask questions and report any issues.

Conduct user training sessions (optional) to familiarize users with the new Strivacity login process and any required self-service actions.

Security Considerations Throughout the Migration

Implement secure practices throughout the entire migration process to protect user data and system integrity. This includes:

Implement security monitoring protocols to add visibility into the new system

Secure hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt) for password storage in Strivacity. ARGON2

Secure data transfer methods during user identity and credential migration. 

Following the principle of least privilege for access controls to the token translation layer and Strivacity administration console.

Regular security testing of the Strivacity login functionalities, token translation layer, and migrated applications for vulnerabilities.

Monitoring and Post-Migration Support

Establish a monitoring plan to track the performance and stability of the new authentication system after migration. This includes monitoring login attempts, application access, and overall system health.

Define clear procedures for incident response and issue resolution in case of any problems after migration.

Provide ongoing support to address any user issues or technical challenges that may arise after the migration is complete.

Success Criteria

Define clear success criteria for the migration project to ensure it meets its objectives. These criteria may include:

Pre-training of customer support so they are prepared for any issues that customers could experience

Successful migration of user identities and credentials to Strivacity.

Functionality of core login processes on Strivacity (login, password reset, MFA).

Maintained SSO functionality for various applications through the token translation layer and direct integrations.

Minimal disruption to user experience during the migration process.

Improved security posture of the authentication system compared to SiteMinder.

Recommendation:

Conduct a proof-of-concept evaluation to assess the feasibility of using APIM for token translation in your environment. This will involve testing APIM's capabilities to translate tokens between SiteMinder and Strivacity.

If the evaluation is successful and APIM meets your requirements, using APIM can be a faster and potentially more cost-effective approach compared to developing a custom token translation layer.
