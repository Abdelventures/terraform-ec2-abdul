Topic: Backend Java Deployment for CERT & Load Balancer Setup

Key Updates & Discussion Points
	1.	Backend Java Deployment for CERT:
	•	Deployment is in progress, with some pipeline-related issues.
	•	Suspected issue is related to memory and resource quotas.
	•	Plan: Update resource quotas in Helm and verify if the issue is resolved.
	•	Target completion: Today or tomorrow.
	2.	Frontend (Angular) Deployment for CERT:
	•	Not started yet.
	•	Planned for next week.
	•	Overall goal: Full application deployment by next week.
	3.	Pipeline & Troubleshooting:
	•	Current issue is suspected to be due to memory limitations.
	•	Plan to adjust resource quotas in OpenShift to match Helm settings.
	•	Will monitor after changes and update the team if further issues arise.
	4.	Load Balancer Setup:
	•	No external load balancer needed for Dev and CERT; OpenShift’s default load balancer will be used.
	•	For Production (Prod) and Disaster Recovery (DR):
	•	Separate load balancers for Prod and DR are required.
	•	Need to confirm if a request has already been raised for the DR load balancer.
	•	Plan to check if DR setup has been provisioned and raise a request if needed.
	5.	Prod DR Environment:
	•	Prod OpenShift environment is set up, but DR setup may not be in place.
	•	Need to verify if a DR request was previously made.
	•	Next steps: Confirm with OpenShift team and raise a request if required.

Action Items:
	1.	Backend Deployment (Java CERT) – [User] to troubleshoot memory issue and complete deployment by tomorrow.
	2.	Frontend Deployment (Angular CERT) – To be started next week.
	3.	Load Balancer Confirmation – [Pushpendra] to check if Prod and DR load balancer requests are in place.
	4.	Prod DR Setup Verification – [User] to check OpenShift setup and raise a request if DR is missing.
	5.	Coordination with OpenShift Team – If needed, escalate the DR request and ensure load balancer setup is completed.

Next Steps & Follow-ups:
	•	Check progress on backend deployment by tomorrow.
	•	Verify DR environment setup and raise requests if necessary.
	•	Align with the OpenShift team for any outstanding configurations.
	•	Prepare for frontend deployment next week.
